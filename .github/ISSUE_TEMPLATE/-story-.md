### Roles

* _Visitor_ of the Gōng-fu I/O website (possibly a candidate _member_)
* _Member_ of the Gōng-fu I/O meetups
* _Practitioner_ of the Gōng-fu I/O meetups (is also a member)
* _Organizer_ of the Gōng-fu I/O meetups (is also a member).

### A good user story should be (I-N-V-E-S-T principle)

* _Independent_ (from other user stories, allowing to realize them in any order);
* _Negotiable_ (omit details that would freeze the story);
* _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
* _Estimatable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
* _Sizable_ (implementation fits in one iteration – if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
* _Testable_ (user must be able to check the conditions of satisfaction).
